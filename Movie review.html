                   The movie is kinda comedy oriented but the concept is exceptionally clear as well. As a
                    woman myself , I find it important that all men should understand what they
                     (the ones refering such to as) men rule the home SHOULLDDD watch this movie. This movie is also one which would make u think over n over. 
                         Basil and Darshana did a great job in executing the characters. The direction
                          was awesome as well as cinematography, music and all the associates who have worked for the film.
